## To Do

- Nothing! v1.0

## Notes

- I have mixed too much of my own CSS with Tailwind instead of learning the Tailwind classes to do the same job

- Stretch features could include: 

- Storing api key as env
- Fix overlapping on mobile
- Error handling
- Manual additions to the database
- Tab-based nav
