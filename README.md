## To Do

- CSS & accessibility 

## Notes

- I have mixed too much of my own CSS with Tailwind instead of learning the Tailwind classes to do the same job
- Stretch features could include: 

- Storing api key as env
- CSS and generally better use of loading animations
- Error handling
- Manual additions to the database
- Tab-based nav
