## Notes

- I learned that it is best to avoid using your own CSS on top of Tailwind classes. If I did the project again I would minimise the amount of vanilla CSS used.


- Stretch features could include: 

- Fix overlapping on mobile
- Error handling
- Manual additions to the database
- Tab button nav
